<h1 class="headers">Fundamentals</h1>

<p class="briefp"> 
    Knowing the fundamentals of computing gives you the foundations to build on that knowledge, knowing why
    and how things are happening.

</p>

<h2> Components </h2>

<p class="componentsp">
    Inside a computer are transistors to represent the 1s and 0s of binary code by being either on or off.
<br/>
<br/>
    The motherboard connects all components of a computer together such as the CPU, RAM, hard drive,
    connectors for input/output etc.
<br/>
<br/>
    Some of these components are as follows:
<br/>
<br/>
    There is also RAM (Random Access Memory) which is short-term memory that disappears once the system turns
    off. RAM is needed on every device. 
<br/>
<br/>
    HDD (Hard Disk Drive), SSD (Solid State Drive) and Optical Drives (CDs/DVDs) have long-term memory
    and take longer to process information.
<br/>
<br/>
    HDD is the main data storage, it has the operating system on it.
<br/>
<br/>
    SSD is faster and more advanced, with no moving parts (unlike HDD)
    Unlike the volatile nature of RAM, these retain access to the data.
<br/>
<br/>
    The Power Supply is a hardware component that supplies electricity to the machine, it would be
    pretty useless without one.
<br/>
<br/>
    The GPU is a graphics processing unit, it allows graphics to be rendered in an efficient and effective manner.
<br/>
<br/>
    Servers allow for a centralised storage. This can be fore files, printer jobs, CCTV footage,
    e-mails, databases etc.

<br/>
    Examples:
    Web Server- web storage
    File Server- for computers on same network
    Print Server- connects to a printer
    Application Server- like google docs operates and stores online
    Media Server- files are streamed as opposed to being sent in full
<br/>
<br/>
    The Router connects to devices to provide internet communication.
<br/>
<br/>

<h2> Data </h2>

<p class="datap">

    Data can be represented in multiple ways, such as words, numbers, images, sounds and bytes.

    Numeric: (integers and floats)
    String: ("Characters")
    Boolean: True / False
    Lists: [arrays used to store many elements]

    Data can be stored in several ways. 

    Direct Area Storage(DAS): is the storage local to your specific machine.
    Network Based Storage: is off-site and can be accessed by different machines.


</p>

<h2>Storage Measurements</h2>

<p class="briefp2"> 
    Storage measurements go up to a very high amount, but here are a few:
</p>

<table class="storagetable">

    <tr>
        <td>Name</td>
        <td>Factor</td>
        <td>Amount</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Kilobyte(KB)</td>
        <td>10^3</td>
        <td>1,000 bytes</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Megabyte</td>
        <td>10^6</td>
        <td>1,000,000,000 bytes</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Gigabyte</td>
        <td>10^9</td>
        <td>1,000,000,000 bytes</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Terabyte</td>
        <td>10^12</td>
        <td>1,000,000,000,000 bytes</td>
    </tr>

<h2>The Internet</h2>

<p class="internetp">
    The internet is an example of Wide Area Network (WAN(. It is of the  biggest WAN in the world.
    A Wide Area Network is not limited to a single location, but it spans over a large geographical area 
    through a telephone line, fibre optic cable or satellite links. 
<br/>
    A Wide Area Network is widely used in the field of business, government, and education.
<br/>
    A Local Area Network, however, is the common, limited area coverage such the wifi in a home.
<br/>
<br/>
    The way the data arrives at your computer is through it's IP address,
    which allows the data to be sent to your unique location.
<br/>
<br/> 
    Transmission control protocol (TCP) 
    drives reliable data transfers while user datagram protocol (UDP) 
    prioritizes speed and efficiency. 
<br/>
    But both are a method in which pockets of data are transferred between devices,
    whilst checking for errors along the way. 
<br/>
    Using a Transport Layer Security (TLS) you can send encrypted data -
    preventing it from being seen by anyone who shouldn't.
<br/>
<br/> 
    In order for your browser to the load the information of webpages you are 
    looking at on the internet, hhtp and dns protocols are used. DNS (Domain Name System) is the system and protocol that translates
    domain names to IP addresses and more. 
    HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is used to transfer webpages.
</p>


<h2>Network Topologies</h2>

    <p class="topologiesp">
    A Network Topology is the way in which a collection of systems are connected.
    Here are a few examples:
    </p>

<h3>Bus Topology</h3>

<img class="bustop" src="bustop.jpg">

    <p class="topologiesp">
    All devices in the network are connected by one central RJ-45 network cable or coaxial cable.
    The single cable which transmits the data between all devices is referred to as a bus or backbone.
    </p>

<h3>Star Topology</h3>

<img class="startop" src="startop.jpg">

    <p class="topologiesp">
        The Star Topology uses a centralised hub to connect to each host simulataneously. 
    </p>

    <h3>Mesh Topology</h3>

    <img class="meshtop" src="meshtop.jpg">
    
    <p class="topologiesp">
        The Mesh Topology is a LAN with as many nodes between each client for 
        an efficient data route.
    </p>
    

    <h3>Ring Topology</h3>

    <img class="ringtop" src="ringtop.jpg">
        
    <p class="topologiesp">
        The Ring Topology has each node connecting to two other nodes
        from either side, forming a single continuous pathway for data to transmit.
    </p>
        

<h2>Binary Code</h2>

<p class="binaryp">
    A binary digit is the smallest a computer can store. 

    A compiler will have translated a programming language into binary code for the computer system.

    The binary code system works as follows:

</p>

<p class="binaryp">
    Using this system, you can figure out that the number 9 is: <br/>

    1 (2^3 or x8), 0 (2^2 or x4), 0 (2^1 or x2), 1 (2^0 or x1). </br>

    As there is one 8 and one 1 to make 9 in the simplest manner.

    Other datatypes also have their own binary numbers, but they'd be much longer.

</p>

<img class="binaryimg" src="binary.jpg">

<h2>Boolean Algebra</h2>

<p class="booleanp">
    Boolean Algebra uses True or False to represent 1s and 0s respectively. <br/>

    There are different types of Logic Gates that use boolean algebra, here
    are some visual representations:
    
</p>

<img class="gatesimg" src="logicgates.jpg">

<p class="booleanp">
    


<br/>
    <b>NOT</b> gates take one input and produces one output, this is called an inverter.<br/>
    Input true = false <br/>
    Input False = true <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    <b>AND</b> gates take two or more inputs and produce one output.
    Returns true if all inputs are true.<br/>
    Both false = false <br/>
    One false/ one true = false <br/>
    Both true = true <br/>
</br>
<br/>
    <b>NAND</b> gates take two inputs and provides one output, which is inverted. </br>
    Both false = true <br/>
    One false/ one true = true <br/>
    Both true = false <br/>
</br>
<br/>
    <b>OR</b> gates takes two or more inputs and produces one output, 
    returns true is one is true. </br>
    Both false = false </br>
    One false/ one true = true </br>
    Both true = true </br>
</br>
<br/>
    <b>XOR</b> gate, or exclusive-or, takes two inputs and produces one output.
    It excludes both outputs being the same.</br>
    Both false = false </br>
    One false/ one true = true </br>
    Both true = false </br>
</br>
<br/>
    <b>NOR</b> gates take two or more inputs and produces one output, an inverted-OR.</br>
    Both false = true</br>
    One false/ one true = false </br>
    Both true = false </br> 
</br>
<br/>
    <b>EXNOR</b> gates, excluvise-nor, can only take two inputs and produce one output.
    It is an inverted EXOR. </br>
    Both false = true </br>
    One false/ one true = false </br>
    Both true = false </br>
</br>   
</br>
