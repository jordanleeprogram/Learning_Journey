<h1 class="headers">Coding Basics</h1>

<p class="briefp"> 
    There are different types of programming languages, as well 
    different programming languages themselves, but they share many fundamental similaries. <br/>
    This page has information about different programming languages, different types of 
    programming languages, functions and coding principles.

<h3> Programming Languages </h3>

<p class="langp"> 
    
    HTML: <br/><br/>

    Hypertext Markup Language is the skeleton of a website. <br/>
    A markup language puts the structure in place for other languages to be written and displayed.

    <br/><br/><br/>

    CSS: <br/><br/>
    Cascading Style Sheets is used in conjunction to HTML as it styles the elements stated by HTML.<br/>
    This is like the hair and clothing if HTML is the skeleton.

    <br/><br/><br/>

    Javascript: <br/><br/>
    JS is multi-paradigm, it supports event-drivem, functional and imperative programming styles. <br/>
    It is used to create interactivity on websites, add functionality, creatre user accounts,
    send and request the data to the servers and databases and more.

    <br/><br/><br/>



    Python: <br/><br/>
    Python is a multi-paradigm, object-oriented, procedural (imperative), functional programming language.<br/>

    It can be used for web applications and data-analysis. 



<br/><br/><br/>

    SQL: <br/><br/>

    SQL stands for Structured Query Language and is domain-specific. <br/>
    It is used in programing to store, manipulate and retrieve data from databses.

    In the example below I styled my button with states, shadows and transitions. It can be found on the 
     <a class="froglink" href="index.html">Home</a> page.    <br/><br/>
     The subtle changes in states, such as the border radius (roundness) and 
     the border shadow increasing or decreasing incrementally and chronologically makes for a smooth animation.

<h3> CSS Flexbox demonstration</h3>

<div class="flexbox">

      <h4> 1.CSS </h4>  
      <h4> 2.CSS </h4> 
      <h4> 3.CSS </h4> 
      <h4> 4.CSS </h4> 
      

</div>

<p class="mylanguagesp">


    The '.flexbox' is the name of the div class containing the 4 CSS titled headers. <br/>
    It has made the text go in reverse order and have an equal space around them from margin to margin.  <br/><br/>

    The '.flexbox h4' targets the CSS titled header 4s as individual elements to be customised. <br/>
    The following font-families are back-ups, in order, incase a browser doesn't support the original font.

    <br/><br/>

    Justify-content aligns items horizontally and accepts the following values:<br/><br/>
    flex-start: Items align to the left side of the container. 
    flex-end: Items align to the right side of the container. 
    center: Items align at the center of the container. 
    space-between: Items display with equal spacing between them. 
    space-around: Items display with equal spacing around them.



    It will be worth visiting <a class="froglink" href=""https://flexboxfroggy.com/> the Flexbox Frog game </a>to revise the basics.<br/><br/>

<h3> Transition example CSS </h3>

<p class="mylanguagesp"> 

    Hovering over the parent Div (blue field) will make the child Div (red field) 
    animate across the X-axis in 5 seconds. <br/>

    You will notice that upon removing the cursor from the parent field returns the 
    child Div (red field) back to its original position as the same speed. <br/>

    This is because I have ALSO added the 'transition:5s' property to the '.child' in CSS, as well. <br/>

    The colour of the child Div will also gradually change color, as the ':hover' state in CSS 
    has been allocated the color pink (it's almost white) AS WELL AS the transition property. Meaning that 
    it not only traverses the X-axis over 5 seconds, but also changes color over 5 seconds.

<h3>Python</h3>

<p class="mylanguagesp">

    



Datatypes. <br/><br/>

Strings store a series of characters: "string of words". <br/><br/>

Integers store whole numbers: 54 <br/><br/>

Floats store decimal numbers: 250.5 <br/><br/>

Booleans store true of false: True/False <br/>
human = False <br/>
print ("Are you a human?: " +str(human) ) #typecasted <br/><br/>

Multiple assignment.  <br/><br/>

Instead of: <br/><br/>

name = "Jordan" <br/>
age = 24 <br/>
hair = "ginger" <br/>
attractive = True <br/><br/>

You can assign multiple variables in one line of code: <br/><br/>

name, age, hair, attractive = "Jordan ", 24, " ginger ", True <br/><br/>

print(name + str(age) + hair + str(attractive))  #age and attractive had to be typecasted as strings to be concatonated. <br/><br/>

String methods. <br/><br/>

name = "Jordan" <br/><br/>

print(len(name)) #gives length of name <br/>
print(name.find("d")) #finds the number of character beginning with 0 as first letter <br/>
print(name.capitalize()) #capitalizes first letter <br/>
print(name.upper()) #prints in all upper case <br/>
print(name.lower()) #prints in lower case <br/>
print(name.isdigit()) #will state true/false whether string is a digit or not <br/>
print(name.isalpha()) #states whether its only alphabetical characters or not <br/>
print(name.count("d")) #counts number of stated <br/>
print(name.replace("o", "x")) #replaces stated <br/>
print(name*3) #prints it three times <br/><br/>

Typecasting. Changing data type.  <br/><br/>

#x = 1 <br/>
#y = 2.0 <br/>
#z = "3" <br/><br/>

You cannot normally perform math on strings. <br/><br/>

y = int(y) #now shows just as 2, and integer not a float  <br/>
z = int(z) #can now do math on it as if it was in integer <br/><br/>
 
x = float(x) #shows all as decimals now <br/>
y = float(y)<br/>
z = float(z) <br/><br/>

print(x) <br/>
print(y) <br/>
print(z) <br/><br/>
 
You cannot normally display a string with an integer or a float
therefore converting them to strings allows the calculation to be done.  <br/><br/>

x = str(x) <br/>    #globalising X as a string
y = str(y)<br/>
z = str(z) <br/><br/>

print("X is: " + x) <br/>
print("Y is: " + y) <br/>
print("Z is: " + z) <br/><br/>

Another method of typecasting, this is independtant to the line of code and no globalised. <br/><br/>

print("X is: " + str(x)) <br/>
print("Y is: " + str(y)) <br/>
print("Z is: " + str(z)) <br/><br/>

User input. <br/><br/>

name = input ("What is your name? ") <br/>
#print("Hello " + name ) <br/>

age = int(input("How old are you? ")) <br/>

print(str(age) + "!!  " + "That is very old,  " + name) <br/>

age = age + 1 <br/>

print ("So next you're you will be " + str(age)) <br/>


name = input ("What is your name? ") <br/>
print("Hello " + name ) <br/>

age = int(input("How old are you? ")) <br/>

print(str(age) + "!!  " + "That is very old,  " + name) <br/>

age = age + 1 <br/>

print("So next you're you will be " + str(age)) <br/>

height = float(input("How tall are you? ")) <br/>

print(str(height) + "cm" + " that's tall!") <br/><br/>


Math. <br/><br/>

import math <br/><br/> #imports are usually built in to python but need importing  <br/><br/>

pi = 3.1415 <br/>
x = 2<br/>
y = 3<br/>
z = 4<br/><br/>



print(round(pi)) #round to nearest hole <br/>
print(math.ceil(pi)) #round up <br/>
print(math.floor(pi)) #round down <br/>
print(abs(pi)) #tells you how far number is from 0 <br/>
print(pow(pi,2)) #power of 2 <br/>
print(math.sqrt(pi)) #finds square root <br/>
print(max(x,y,pi)) #finds highest value <br/>
print(min(z,x,pi)) #finds lowest value <br/><br/>

Slicing and Indexing.  <br/><br/>

indexing [] slicing () <br/>
[start:stop:step] <br/>
 
name = "Jordan Dignan" <br/>

first_name = name [0:6] <br/>
last_name = name [7:13] <br/> <br/>

Can be written easier as: <br/><br/>

first_name = name [:6] from start to 6<br/>
last_name = name [7:] from 7 to end<br/>

funky_name = name [0:13:3] #[start:stop:step]<br/>

reversed_name = name [::-1] #can leave them blank as python knows its from start to end when bank <br/><br/>



print(first_name) <br/><br/>
print(last_name) <br/>
print(funky_name) #every 3rd character including first <br/>
print(reversed_name) <br/>

name = "Jordan Dignan" <br/>

slice = slice(3,-2) <br/>

print(name[slice]) #shows the slice of string from 3rd character from left to second char from right <br/><br/>

If statements. <br/><br/>

age = int(input("How old are you? ")) <br/><br/>

if age >= 18:<br/>
    print("You may have the beer") #only indent for block of code within each part loops!!!<br/><br/>

elif age == 100:    #double equals == is to check is a value is the same as another. NOT to say that is is.<br/>
    print("Wow, you're old") #this code will not run, as 100 is over 18, the program will skip the rest of the loops<br/><br/>

elif age < 0: #match indents! <br/>
    print("How are you even doing this?") #indent! <br/><br/>

else: #no indent!<br/>
    print("No beer for you") #indent!<br/><br/>


answer = input("do you like one or two?")<br/><br/>

if answer == "one":<br/>
    print("A wise choice")<br/><br/>

elif answer == "two":<br/>
    print("A poor choice")<br/><br/>

else:<br/>
    print("You're a loser. A milk drinker. Begone.")<br/><br/>

Logical Operators: and, or, not. <br/><br/>

temp = int(input("What's the temperature outside?")) <br/><br/>

if temp >=0 and temp <= 30:<br/>
    print("Oh, it's not too bad outside today at " + str(temp) + " degrees") <br/><br/>

elif temp <0 or temp >30 :     #as long as at least ONE 'or' is true, statement will show <br/>
    print("That's some extreme weather at " + str(temp) + " degrees") <br/><br/>
else:<br/>
     quit() <br/><br/>

temp = int(input("What's the temperature outside?")) <br/><br/>

if not temp >=0 and temp <= 30: #the NOT takes a true statement and makes it false, therefore output here is wrong
                                    #way round <br/>
    print("Oh, it's not too bad outside today at " + str(temp) + " degrees") <br/><br/>

elif not temp <0 or temp >30 : <br/>
    print("That's some extreme weather at " + str(temp) + " degrees") <br/><br/>

else: <br/>
    quit()<br/><br/>

<h3> Programming Types </h3>

<p class="typesp"> 
    Different languages operate in different manners. These 
    different types are classified as programming paradigms. Here are some examples: <br/><br/><br/>

    Procedural language: <br/><br/>

    In procedural languages, the program code is written as a sequence of instructions. 
    User has to specify “what to do” and also “how to do” (step by step procedure). 
    These instructions are executed in the sequential order.
    These instructions are written to solve specific problems.
    

    <br/><br/><br/>

    Object-oriented language: <br/><br/>

    Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a style of programming characterized by the identification of 
    classes of objects closely linked with the methods (functions) with which they are associated. 
    It also includes ideas of inheritance of attributes and methods.

    <br/><br/><br/>

    Imperative programming: <br/><br/>

    In imperative programming, every operation is coded and the code itself specifies how the problem is to be solved, 
    which means that pre-coded models are not called on.

    <br/><br/><br/>

    Domain-specific language: <br/><br/>

    Such as SQL,  is a type of computer language of limited scope, 
    designed to address a particular problem within an application domain

    <br/><br/><br/>

</p>

<h3>Coding Princples</h3>

<p class="principlesp">
    There are general rules and guidlines that programmers tend to follow. These makes syntax more universal as everyone
    pitches in to keep others updated on the most efficient way to code. Here are some examples of principles:
<br/><br/><br/>

KISS: Keep it short and simple. Programs run best when code is concise and simple.

<br/><br/>

DRY: Dont Repeat Yourself. Using Functions/Loops is the efficient way of doing this and can cause less bugs and crashes.

<br/><br/>

Refactoring code: regularly examing and revising your code will make you a better programmer and make your program better. <br/>
It will take you less time to figure out errors.

<br/><br/>

Document your code: leaving comments that are glossed over by he machine allow you to keep track of your code and 
allows colleagues to examine your code more easily.


</p>

<h3>Key Terms</h3>

<p class="keytermsp">

Algorithm: a set of instructions followed to solve a problem or process <br/><br/>


Argument: a way to provide information to a function. Function then uses the information as it runs, 
like a variable. <br/><br/>



Arrays: are containers that hold variables, used to group similar variables. 
It is a list with elements; the array is like a shelf and the things on it are the variables. <br/><br/>



Arithmetic operators: is essential in applications. It does mathematic operations. <br/>
eg. If a character in a game earns XP it has to be added, if they take damage health has to be subtracted etc 
<br/><br/>



Assignment operators: perform operations. For example the assignment operator "="" assigns it as equalled <br/>
Whereas the assignment operator "+"" will add them together etc.
<br/><br/>


IDE (Integrated Developemnt Environment):  a software application that provides comprehensive 
facilities to computer programmers for software development. <br/><br/>

Source code: the statements that are created by a programmer in the IDE. <br/><br/>


Syntax: the way it has to be written to be understood by that language, i.e the grammar <br/><br/>
