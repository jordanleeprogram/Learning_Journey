<h1 class="headers">Porfolio of Jordan Lee James Dignan</h1>

<p class="briefp"> 
    My name is Jordan Dignan. I was born in North Manchester on a crisp Sunday 'eve in 1998. <br/>
    This portfolio page will detail moments in my life, my hobbies and interests, and why I want to become 
    a software programmer.

</p>

<h2>About Jordan</h2>

<p class="aboutmep">
    
    I am 24 years old and I am hoping to start a career in software and web development. However I how found an interest 
    in back-end programming and therefore I am striving to achieve full-stack knowledge.
<br/>
<br/>
    I get enjoy many things such as football and other sports, video games, TV and Film, reading and writing. I don't necessarily keep to
    a single interest in terms of my personal hobbies, I'm always happy to try new things and I often end up liking them.

<h3> Hobbies and Interests </h3>

<p class="hobbiesp"> 
    I have many different hobbies that I uptake at different times. However, exloring (such as hiking or adventuring),
    playing football and being active are what I enjoy most. <br/><br/>

    Amongst that, I also love to delve into fantasy worlds such as The Elder Scrolls or The 
    Lord of the Rings. This side to my passions is vastly different to my others but I feel that escapism 
    is important and I also feel that such works hold concepts, teachings and stories that have helped
    me grow as an individual as I have applied them to real life.

    <br/><br/>

    Things that interest me are usually things I have to learn about that have a wide collection of
    different people's thoughts, ideas and methods. This is why I study history in some of my free time, 
    I also feel it is important to be knowledgable about the people who struggled before us; out of respect.
    <br/><br/>
    Similarly, I have evolved from someone who had a vague interst in programming and computing, 
    but was far too daunted by the concept, to someone who is absolutely fascinated by it and 
    endeavour to pursue a career in it. I did this by practising, learning basics, joining the 
    Codenation course and practising Python after classes.
    <br/><br/>

<h3>My Skills</h3>

<p class="skillsp">

The skill I pride myself on tbe most is my ability to learn new skills quickly. <br/>
Particularly, when I'm interested and passionate about something, 
I endeavour to find out everything I can and to become as good as it as possible. <br/>
Despite this type of attitude being a double-edged sword, I find it will come to great use when
I manage to settle on a career pathway. 

<br/><br/>

Most importantly, my people skills and my communication skills have facilitated many
amazing interactions and friendships and opportunities. I am incredibly grateful to have this skill, I
feel very lost when I am without it.

<br/><br/>

Furthermore, my passion and education in English Language and Literature has given me 
a high level or writing skill, particularly in an academic style. However, my passion mainly
revolves around creative writing; I intend to author at least one work of fiction on my lifetime.

<br/><br/>

With these main skills at my disposal, I believe I can an innovative addition to 
software development industry. <br/><br/>

Regarding my ability to learn new skills quickly, amongst my ability to retain and absorb large amounts of 
information, I am equipped to keep up-to-date and knowledgable about an industry that changes so quickly. 
<br/><br/>

Having people skills will allow me to comfortably and confidently network with colleagues and potential clients
which will both strenghten the relationship as well as provide a clearer image of the goal at hand.

<br/><br/>

My academic, pursuasive and creative writing abiltiies would be useful when communicating and conveying ideas
to potential clients via e-mail or blog post or advertisement etc. <br/>
Furthermore, it may be a bonus to some development teams to have a programmer who can contribute to 
adding content as well as coding.

</p>

<h3>Skills I Wish to Develop</h3>

<p class="developp"> 

As a programmer, I would like to be full-stack. <br/>

Firstly, because I enjoy knowing in-depth what is is that I'm doing. This gives me confidence, 
by knowing the inner-workings. This is why I have enjoyed the variety of knowledge I have learned so 
far in the Codenation course.

<br/>
<br/>

Secondly, it will make me more employable when finding a job, and in turn I will be
a more useful employee for the business.

<br/>
<br/>

Since the week leading to the beginning my Codention course I began refreshing my memory
about HTML and CSS. I have been researching and practising for a few hours after each class
and now I feel fairly confident with these languages.

<br/>
<br/>

I have also been attempting to learn Python, I have ordered a book and watched several tutorials online. <br/>
I feel it is important to practise coding rather than copying code and therefore I took some time to
program some things in Python by myself in Pycharm. <br/>
So far I can perform some basic functions and I have programmed a 10 question quiz which 
adds up your total score and displays it out of 10 and also as a percertange.

<br/><br/>

I would like to strengthen my skills in Python, and eventually learn the C languages and Javascript. <br/>
In addition, I would like to find a niche; such as 
mastering a framework.

<br/><br/>

I would also like to learn as much as I can about computing in general, 
as I often encounter difficulties and errors with minute details such as with files,
paths and system settings.

<h3> Places I'd like to visit </h3>

    <p class="placesp"> 

    In my time I have been to some great places, such as Florida, Rome and Barcelona. <br/>
    But there are still many places I wish to see. Here are three of them: </p>
    
    <h3>India</h3>

    <p class="briefp"> 

    The reason I would like to see India is the culture and history, bost most importantly; the food.

</p>


    <h3>Ireland</h3>

    <img class="irelandimg" src="ireland.jpg">



    <p class="briefp"> 

       I'm interested in seeing how I feel being at the location that many generations
